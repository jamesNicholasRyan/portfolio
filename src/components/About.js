      I am a software developer with previous experience in the music and audio industries. My interest in coding began after self-teaching in Processing, a creative Java port. I grew inspired by the ability to be innovative and fun with programming and I have since been on a journey to create new and exciting things with the skills I have learnt. Whilst concatenating my expertise in previous roles, I am looking to work as a software developer in a fast paced, creative environment, where people share ideas and I can learn from others.
